# Customer Churn Prediction with Neural Network

Customer churn prediction is a crucial aspect of customer retention strategy for businesses. This project leverages a neural network to classify whether a customer is likely to churn based on historical data. The implementation uses Python, TensorFlow/Keras, and Scikit-learn, providing end-to-end functionality including preprocessing, training, evaluation, and saving the model.

## Overview
Customer churn refers to when a customer stops doing business or ends a subscription with a company. Identifying potential churners early can help organizations take preventive actions. This project trains a neural network on customer behavioral data to predict churn.

## Problem Statement
The objective is to build a predictive model that determines whether a customer will churn based on features such as tenure, contract type, monthly charges, payment method, etc. We aim to:
- Clean and preprocess the dataset
- Encode categorical features
- Scale numerical features
- Train and evaluate a deep learning model
- Save the model and preprocessing objects
- Visualize training history

## Dataset
We use the [Telco Customer Churn Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn). It includes 7,043 rows and 21 columns, each representing customer-related features such as demographics, account information, and services used.

### Key Columns:
- **customerID**: Unique identifier for each customer
- **gender, SeniorCitizen, Partner, Dependents**: Demographic info
- **tenure, MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges**: Account and usage data
- **Churn**: Target variable (Yes/No)

## Hyperparameter Tuning
Currently, the project uses fixed hyperparameters. To improve performance:
- Integrate Keras Tuner or Optuna for automated search
- Tune: number of layers, neurons per layer, activation functions, learning rate, batch size
